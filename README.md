localization-spreadsheet-jsonify
================================

A Google App Script that lets you easily access a localization/translation 
Google spreadsheet in JSON format. In other words, you can put together a 
string translation table in Google Docs, and this script will export it
to JSON for you with a minimum of effort.

To see it in action, go to:
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxLnEUyElPtL01qHnL7pD2hmTmaO7Tc1yLhjJzQpitpuBfxxBU/exec

Code.js should be copied to the Google App Scripts system as Code.gs.
